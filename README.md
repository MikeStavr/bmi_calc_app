# BMI Calculator App

A simple application I was playing around with, the first I've created.

It uses flutter state management to calculate the BMI of a person along side with hive for saving the BMI calculation if the user desires. 

## Technologies used:

 - [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
 - [Flutter Navigator](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation)
 - [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive)
 - [Flutter State Management](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options#setstate)
